# HAIndy

Hellooooooooooooooooooooooo everyone

Welcome to our project.

  - [Controls](#controls)

About the title: hand + ai = hAInd, and because it's a small project, hAIndy.

And as you may have guessed, we have AI here.  
During Ciklum AI Hackathon 2023 we simulated a robotic hand in Unity and then created a neural network to control it.  
You can get the app and see for yourself in the releases.

## Presentation

## Controls

If you open the zip, you will see an app, sadly there is no icon for Mac version, so it looks scary, but that's not important.  

If you launch the app, neural network will start and control hand for you, if you want to try this yourself and see if you can beat our network, you can press `m` to activate manual mode.  
If you get bored or it's too hard you can always switch to neural network by pressing `n`

As for the arm controls, there are 3 parts of it and each has a motor.  
You use `z` and `x` to control lowest motor, z is left, x is right.  
`a` is left for 2nd part, and `s` is right.  
Finally `q` is left for the tip and `w` is right for the tip.

That's it
